This study explores the novel approach of optimizing artificial intelligence hyperparameters using the genetic algorithm, specifically in application to human facial sentiment analysis through the lens of computational neuroscience. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks in combinations with the genetic algorithm in brain-computer interfacing, particularly in whole-brain emulation, and have significant implications for the field of robotics, artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, and beyond. Further exploration of this area of research can lead to greater breakthrough in understanding of the human mind.
